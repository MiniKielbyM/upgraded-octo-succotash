 * This translation happens based on "visual appearance" of the letters,

 * alphabet, you will get weird outputs.
 *
 * Disclaimer: This may at times mistranslate messages, and the list of
 * characters that get converted is most likely not complete, although
 * it is very thoroughly assembled. It will remove most common accents,
 * and returns a latin string in lower case letters. Any characters that
 * could not be mapped to latin characters will still appear in the string.

 * Example:
 * "ᵺⓘ꯱ ₮Ꮛ乂Շ" would turn into "this text" or "Z̵̡̭͝ả̶̬̘̈́l̶̜͗g̵̜̲͒́o̶̞̅̊" turns into "zalgo", or
 * "ᑕⓞ֑ο̤͕𝕃ܑׅ" turns into "cool".
